# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
"Data analysis and visualization of road accidents in India  using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visual insights."
Road Accident Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data in India (2020) to identify patterns, trends, and insights using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset includes accident counts, casualties, and state-wise statistics. The goal is to uncover key factors influencing road safety and present findings through visualizations.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (Govt. of India) / Open Data

File Used: accident_prediction_india.csv

Features Include:

State/UT

Number of accidents

Number of fatalities

Number of injuries

Year

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used
Language: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas â€“ Data manipulation

matplotlib & seaborn â€“ Data visualization

numpy â€“ Numerical operations

ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
Data Loading â€“ Imported dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning â€“ Checked for missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Generated descriptive statistics and trends.

Visualization â€“

Bar charts for top accident-prone states.

Pie chart showing accident distribution by state.

Line chart showing fatalities over time.

Insights Generation â€“ Identified high-risk states and patterns in road accidents.

ðŸ“Œ Insights
States like Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra have the highest number of accidents.

Fatalities are disproportionately high in certain states despite fewer accidents.

Seasonal and geographical factors may influence accident rates
